# Title : Boosting for Imbalanced Datasets with XGBoost

## Problem Statement:

Handling imbalanced datasets is a major challenge in machine learning. Common algorithms like SVM and Random Forest often struggle when the target classes are imbalanced. Boosting techniques like XGBoost can help improve the accuracy of classifiers by adjusting the model’s focus on underrepresented classes. This project aims to apply XGBoost to handle imbalanced datasets and improve classification performance.

## Objectives:

Use XGBoost to apply boosting techniques for classification tasks.
Address class imbalance by using weighted loss functions and techniques like SMOTE or class balancing.
Tune XGBoost hyperparameters for improved performance (learning rate, max depth, n_estimators).
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics suited for imbalanced data, such as Precision-Recall curves.

## Outcomes:

An XGBoost model that handles imbalanced datasets effectively.
Performance metrics demonstrating how XGBoost improves classification on imbalanced data.

## Deliverables:

### 1. XGBoost Model Implementation:

Python code implementing XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

### 2. Class Imbalance Handling:

Documentation on techniques used to handle class imbalance (e.g., class weights, SMOTE).

### 3. Performance Evaluation Report:

Evaluation results using Precision-Recall curves, ROC-AUC, and other metrics suited for imbalanced datasets.
